# BLE protocol

The monitor is a BLE GATT peripheral named `BatteryMonitor`. It exposes the
custom service:

```text
7d9f0000-9c65-4d3d-bdd5-8f4c6b2e1000
```

The existing readable text characteristics remain supported for diagnostics and
generic tools such as nRF Connect. The mobile app subscribes to the Binary
Telemetry characteristic:

```text
7d9f0009-9c65-4d3d-bdd5-8f4c6b2e1000
```

It supports `Read` and `Notify`. Firmware updates it after each completed
measurement pass (currently every 500 ms). It is a fixed 20-byte little-endian
packet, deliberately small enough to fit in the initial BLE ATT notification
payload. The app must not rely on MTU negotiation for live telemetry.

## Binary Telemetry v1

| Offset | Size | Type | Field | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | `uint8` | version and flags | High nibble is protocol version (`1`). Low nibble: bit 0 voltage valid, bit 1 current valid, bit 2 power valid, bit 3 temperature valid. Ignore other bits. |
| 1 | 2 | `uint16` | sequence | Little-endian measurement sequence, modulo 65,536. It increases for each completed sample. |
| 3 | 2 | `uint16` | voltage | Millivolts. Valid only when the voltage flag is set. |
| 5 | 3 | `int24` | current | Signed milliamps. Positive is battery discharge. Valid only when the current flag is set. |
| 8 | 3 | `int24` | power | Signed milliwatts. Positive is battery discharge. Valid only when the power flag is set. |
| 11 | 1 | `int8` | temperature | Degrees Celsius, rounded to the nearest whole degree. Valid only when the temperature flag is set. |
| 12 | 4 | `int32` | net charge | Signed milliamp-hours for this power-on session. Positive is discharge. |
| 16 | 4 | `int32` | net energy | Signed milliwatt-hours for this power-on session. Positive is discharge. |

For invalid live fields, the packet transmits zero and clears the matching
flag; use the flag rather than treating zero as an error. Energy fields are
saturated only if their signed 32-bit scaled range is exceeded.

## Compatibility rules

The app accepts a packet only when it is exactly 20 bytes and its high-nibble
version is supported. A future incompatible packet uses a new characteristic
UUID and a new version number; Binary Telemetry v1 remains available for
existing app releases. Do not identify a monitor by a phone-provided BLE ID:
iOS provides a privacy-scoped identifier that can change.
